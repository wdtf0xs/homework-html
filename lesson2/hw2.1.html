<p><b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scottish_novelists">Scottish novelist</a> and playwright
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie">J. M. Barrie</a>. A free-spirited and
    mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures
    on the mythical island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland">Neverland</a> as the leader of the <a

    chapters 13–18 published in
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a></i>

    (1904,
    which expanded into the 1911 novel
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter and Wendy</a></i>), the character has been featured
    in a
    variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding
    on Barrie's works. These include several films, television series and many other works.</p>

<p>Barrie commissioned a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_statue">statue of Peter Pan</a> by the
    sculptor
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frampton">George Frampton</a>, which was erected overnight in <a

    surprise to the children of London.<sup><a

    from the

<h2 class="item2">Origin</h2>
<hr>
<p>Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's The <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird">Little White Bird</a></i> (1902), a novel for adults. In chapters
    13–18, titled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens">Kensington Gardens</a> in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as
    "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of
    his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)">stage play</a> titled <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</a></i>, which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York%27s_Theatre">Duke of
        York's Theatre</a> in London.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodder_%26_Stoughton">Hodder and Stoughton</a>,
    extracted the Peter Pan chapters of <i>The Little White Bird</i> and published them in 1906 under the title <i><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens">Peter Pan in
        Kensington Gardens</a></i>, with the addition of illustrations by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rackham">Arthur Rackham</a>.<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Barrie later adapted and expanded the
    1904 play's storyline as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel">novel</a>, which was published in 1911 as
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter and Wendy</a></i>.</p>
<p>J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating
    accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.<sup><a
